# Disease Prediction from Medical Data

## ✅ Project Overview
This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship** with **CodeAlpha**. The goal is to predict common diseases (Diabetes, Heart Disease and Breast Cancer) using structured medical data.

## 📁 Datasets Used
- **Diabetes Dataset** ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set))
- **Heart Disease Dataset** ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction))
- **Breast Cancer Dataset** ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data))

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict whether a person is diabetic or not.
- Predict the risk of heart disease based on clinical features.
- Classify tumors as **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)** using supervised machine learning.

## 🧠 ML Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score

## 📊 Model Performance:
  **Diabetes Model**
    ROC-AUC: 0.8196
  **Heart Disease model**
    ROC-AUC: 0.9008
  **Breast Cancer model**
    ROC-AUC: 0.9973
